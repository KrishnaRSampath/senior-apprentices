# Senior Apprentices
This is a repository to honor and celebrate our Senior Apprentices!

Each of the people named below has served as a Senior Apprentice for the Apprentice100 Software Developer Apprenticeship Program (http://apprentice100.com).

Senior Apprentices serve as mentors for Apprentices in subsequent Cohorts of the Program by assisting with training and code review, coaching Apprentices technically to aid them in their project work, and providing feedback on their demos. They are selected on the basis of their performance as Apprentices, including mastering all aspects of A100’s Minimum Viable Skillset™ for a software developer, and having demonstrated aptitude in the vital areas of full-stack application development, technical communication, and peer mentoring.
